__Instructions__

The program requires Python 3 and is only tested under the environment Python 3.6.5. Two additional but common packages, `numpy` and `matplotlib` are also required. If you do not have them installed, they can be installed via pip:

```
pip install numpy==1.19.2
pip install matplotlib==3.3.4
```

The program can be easily run in the terminal as:

```shell
python project_1.py
```

The three replicated figures will saved in the local working directory. Feel free to tune the parameters and rerun the program.
