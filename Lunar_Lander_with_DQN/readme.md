__Instructions__

The program requires Python 3 and is only tested under  Python 3.6.5. Necessary packages are included in the `requirements.txt` file. You may set up the environment from the file.



The hyper-parameters can be tuned in the code file. Then the agent can be trained with command

```shell
python lunar.py
```

By default, the agent will store the weights and model parameters in the local file `model.pt` and also two images: rewards for each training episode and rewards of testing episodes.
